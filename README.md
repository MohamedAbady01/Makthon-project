# Makthon-project
Begin with a brief overview that outlines the project's purpose and functionality. For example:​  This project implements real-time object tracking using OpenCV's CamShift algorithm. It allows users to select a region of interest (ROI) in a video feed and tracks the object's movement dynamically.

## Introduction

This project implements real-time object tracking using OpenCV's Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CamShift) algorithm. The CamShift algorithm enhances the Mean Shift algorithm by dynamically adjusting the size and orientation of the search window, allowing for more robust tracking of objects that change in size or orientation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Features

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
2.Navigate to the Project Directory:
    
    cd your-repo-name
3. Install Required Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the necessary packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

2.Select the ROI:

After launching, a window will display the video feed. Use the mouse to select the object you wish to track.

3.Tracking:

Once the ROI is selected, the algorithm will commence tracking, highlighting the object's movement with a bounding box.

## Code Overview
Initialization: Initializes video capture and allows user to select the ROI.​

Histogram Calculation: Computes the color histogram of the selected ROI for tracking.​

Tracking Loop: Continuously captures frames, applies the CamShift algorithm, and updates the position of the bounding box around the tracked object.
